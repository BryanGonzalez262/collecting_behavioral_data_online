# What is this course about
<hr>

- Online data collection for psychological experiments and surveys
- **NOT** about user tracking (e.g., cookies, browsing patterns, search behavior)
- Basically "regular behavioral psychology experiments in a browser"
- Also about leveraging large online labor markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk for subject recruitment

# Why do we need a course about this?
<hr>

- **Experiments in the browers are more complex than regular experiments**
- All data is coming to you over the internet which can intermittantly drop out
- Tens or hundreds of participants might view you experiment in 1 hour.  Need reliability, speed.
- Many different browsers (Safari, Chrome, IE) present UI problems (will your experiment look correct?)
- You may want to monitor activity of user (e.g., mouse movement, switching windows, etc...)
- How you design an experiment for non-psych 101 subject pool participants may be different
- You don't have a captive audience (people can leave and watch youtube... there's an art to making it reasonably good)
- Requires knowledge of CSS/Javascript/Databases, etc...

# Why is this good stuff to learn?
<hr>

- Increase your research productivity.  
- More studies with larger samples.
- If you design experiment to be web-enabled can still run in lab of course
- **Direct replication**
- Leverage the ideas/tools of an **immense** web development community may help you develop better/more interesting experiments
- An employable skill

# This is a "Flipped" Classroom
<hr>

- Traditional courses, you attend lectures, work on problem sets, programming at home
- In a [flipped classroom](http://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom/), you want videos/read **before** class, then in class is spent entirely in discussion, problem solving, debugging, sharing hints.
- Get more feedback
- Don't spend hours fighting a simple bug when getting started
- Hopefully limits fustration
- I've never done this before, so let's see how it goes

# Computer requirement
<hr>

- The class is called **online** experiments.  You will need to be online during class
- There are no computers in this room
- The labs in the psychology department do not have Internet
- Thus, you need some type of Internet connected device with a real browser and keyboard that you can program on (NOT a tablet)
- Software will require Mac OS X or Linux/Unix.
- Sorry, windows, but you suck for server-side development
- Locate a computer in your lab, borrow one, or buy one (a linux laptop can be had for $200 these days)

# Grading
<hr>

- **15%** In class attendence/participation
- **85%** Final project

---

class: middle, bright


# The singular goal of this course is to help you build an experiment for your research.
I want you to go back to your labs and share it and get this tool into more people's hands.

# If you are just generally interested in online experiments, don't take this class.
There's not a ton of theory here.  It is a course for makers.

# For next time
<hr>

- Go to class [website](http://gureckislab.org/courses/spring14/online_data_collection/) and read/watch the material for [lecture 2](lecture2.html), complete assignments
- Bring your laptop next time
