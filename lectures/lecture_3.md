# Demographics

1. We talked a bit about the demographics in the last lecture.  [Panos Ipeirotis](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/panos/)
has a nice set of papers explore this and a great [blog post](http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2010/03/new-demographics-of-mechanical-turk.html). Btw, his blog is a really excellent resource.
1. I'm not interested in aggregate statistics today.  I'm interested in people.

"I am having a hard time. Mentally, spiritually, physically, and 
especially financially. My roommate has been out of work for 
almost 2 months, and ran out of money a few weeks ago... I have 
to come up with $$ if he can't to keep this roof over my own 
head. And he does now have a job that he is in training for--tho 
he will not see any money from it for a few MORE weeks. In the 
meantime, rent is due today, and I don't have all of it. I am going 
to have to beg the office to take what I do have, and let me pay 
the rest next paycheck. I could stand that, if that were all there 
was, but the power and internet need to stay on, or NEITHER ONE 
OF US will have any income. I paid the power right before cut off 
last time--that means it can't be long before cut-off notice comes 
a-knockin again. I know the internet bill is like that too now… I 
have been beating my head in trying to do more turking, more 
anything online" (from Martin et al. 2014)

# Stephanie Costello
<hr>
"Costello lives in a trailer at the edge of a desert town in the Southwest. She is 50 and has an associate’s degree in nursing, but she has been unable to find suitable work as a nurse. In 2007, Costello was working at a boring office job and, in slow periods, earning extra money by doing online surveys on Mechanical Turk. When she lost her job at the start of the 2008 recession, she took to Turking full time, often more. What started as a source of extra cash suddenly turned into her main source of income. According to the 2010 study, Costello’s situation may be representative of approximately one in eight Turkers in America, or one in five worldwide." (from Marvit, 2014)

# Rachael Jones
<hr>
"She was trained to assist neurosurgeons, but after a neck injury and surgery, she could no longer work in that physically demanding field. In addition, Jones wanted to stay home and take care of her children while her partner worked outside the home. She is now a “very full-time” Turker and, after several years during which she earned three Masters Qualifications and performed 110,000 HITs, she has been able to make approximately $8 per hour. When asked for her thoughts on Turking, she responded, “I really love it.” She admits that “there are some times when it’s really hard, and you’re scrounging and looking and the HITs that pay just aren’t there.” (from Marvit, 2014)

# Laura Henderson
<hr>
Until 2004, Henderson had a career as a technical trainer in the Pacific Northwest. When that work dried up, she got her bachelor’s degree and joined Teach for America, which assigned her to teach math at a school in New York’s South Bronx. Henderson was assigned to the school midway through the year to replace a beloved teacher and had problems right away. She lost her job and found herself alone in a new city, in debt from the TFA experience and in search of yet another career.

She received unemployment compensation for a period, but for an over-50 worker in a recession, consistent work was hard to find. So Henderson started Turking. “It sounded very interesting when I heard about it—wow, crowdwork. I’ve always been into collaboration and working together and the parts being greater than the whole,” she says. But her enthusiasm quickly waned. “When I started doing it, I realized that the pay is crap. I’m lucky to get $2 per hour.”

When I first interviewed her, Henderson was renting a small room in the Bronx and described herself as “poor and despondent.” In addition to her earnings as a crowdworker, she received $200 a month in food stamps and $180 a month in welfare. She was too poor to maintain a bank account, so she had to spend her Mechanical Turk earnings on Amazon, which she called “the company store.” (from Marvit, 2014)

# Let this sink in...
<hr>

- Despite being a simple mouse click away, crowds are composed of **people**
- Online labor markets naturally are appealing to people without other income means
- In many ways this is **good**
- At same time risk of depersonalization due to anonymity.  These are real people

# Today we are going to talk about the ethics of doing research online
<hr>

- First step along way to actually doing your research online


---
class: middle

# Why are people doing it?

- Answer to this implicit in the previous description: <b>money</b>
- Not just money but access to jobs that are open, flexible, challenging, changing, committement-free
- No travel costs, workplace politics
- For fun?  Enjoyment of mental activities?  To fill up an otherwise boring day/evening?
- For science: people generally may view participating in science studies rewarding
- "Money, and the best way to earn it, underpins much of the discussion about AMT" (on Turker Nation forum)

# The psychology research "labor market"
<hr>

Most academic research in psychology is conducted on a voluntary basis
from human participants recruited one of two ways

1. A university based "subject pool" composed of undergraduates or graduates taking classes
2. Paid volunteers from the general community (often local to universities)

---
class: middle

# Is the subject pool "ethical"?
<hr>

- Students are usually not paid for their time but instead get "credit" for their class
- A key assumption/claim is that doing studies is **educational** demonstrating how experiments are performed, etc...
- Students who decline to participate in some cases are asked to do other school work like write a term paper
- Students usually have to complete a certain number of hours of experiments per semester
- Students can withdraw from a study at any time with no consequence (although depends on university policy... may have to make up additional work)

The logic for the above is largely institutionalized within universities and at the level of
the federal government. 


---
class: middle

# Paid volunteers recruited locally
<hr>

- Paid volunteers are typically offered rate equal to or exceeding minimum wage for hourly work
- In some cases transportation costs are also covered
- Participation is entirely voluntary and people can withdrawl from study at any time and should 
(according to most university rules) receive full or partial compensation

    <p>
    Relative to the subject pool, this is a more ethical arrangement for all parties.  This is
    not saying that using the subject pool is **unethical**, just that it is preferrable that
    people are paid a fair wage for their time and are offered reasonable protections against
    coercion, injury, distress, etc...

# Online crowdsouring markets - In general
<hr>

- Paid volunteers are typically offered rates considerably below minimum wage for hourly work (at least in developed countries) while the pay rate internationally may actually exceed local wage rates
- Volunteers have extremely limited interaction with employers (primarily just reading text on webpage)
- This may not apply to research studies, but in general workers are not unionized while doing work for companies
(e.g., Amazon, Twitter, etc..)
- Workers have very limited recourse for an employer failing to pay, engaging in deceptive practices, etc...
- Companies do not pay employment taxes for the work and it is up to the individual work to correctly pay income taxes

<br>

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Opinion</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
    From the perspective of labor right, this situation maybe viewed somewhere between "bad" and "very bad."
    See [reading](http://www.thenation.com/article/178241/how-crowdworkers-became-ghosts-digital-machine?utm_content=buffer2b563&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#) this week.
    On the other hand, for voluntary psychology experiments this is actually pretty good.  This isn't a 
    employer-employee relationship, people are paid fairly, universities have ethical standard and IRB oversight.

# Is AMT a pure and efficient economic market?

- Is pay rate on AMT set by equilibirum market forces?
- Blogger from Forbes write "apparently half a million people find work at pay rates they're entirely happy with but pay rates that are below minimum wage" (Tom Worstall)

# Gold Mine or Coal Mine?

- Although Amazon claims there are 500,000 workers, Fort et al. paper suggests
that active number is 15K-42K and 80% of tasks are carried out by the 20% most
active people (3K-8K people)
- Studies typically place recruitment restrictions that probably strongly
select from this elite set (i.e., people who have been around for a while)
- Higher wage HITs attract more bots and scammers
- Concern about "market for lemons" - high wages attract bots, which lower
quality of work which incentvizes employers to offer lower wages which 
cause quality people to leave the market

# Online crowdsourcing markets - For use in research
<hr>

*A new type of animal in the academic research world.  It is possible that the ethical
implications have not been completely worked out and may shift over time.*

- Online workers typically paid a rate below minimum wage for developed countries
- Online workers typically paid less than a person in the lab would be paid to do the same effort/study

But...  

- Amount of total work to be done in research is smaller than typical crowdsourcing task (e.g., business applications might require millions of human judgements, a study might need 100 people)
	- unlikely a single lab employs a single subject more than would trigger employement laws
	- however across large universities as a whole that may not be true!
- No effort to come into lab, travel costs, etc... (although to be fair typically travel costs are covered in paid experiments)

# What is average pay in behavioral experiments (N=6)?

I don't know of a general data set on this.  [Dan Bartels](http://home.uchicago.edu/~bartels/) (UChicago Marketing) did informal and anonymous poll of psychologists he knows and traced out ranges (this is unpublished data shared in a email)
<hr>
**Self-volunteered cutoffs of not using tasks that run longer than X**  
7 min (1 respondent)  
10 min (3 respondents)  
15 min (1 respondent)  
20 min (1 respondent)  
<hr>
**Distributions of payment/time**  
*Minutes—25th —— 50th —— 75th*  
03 —— $0.20 —— $0.25 —— $0.30  
06 —— $0.25 —— $0.40 —— $0.49  
09 —— $0.50 —— $0.55 —— $0.75  
12 —— $0.63 —— $0.80 —— $1.10  
15 —— $0.88 —— $1.00 —— $1.38  
18 —— $1.21 —— $1.38 —— $1.73

# A word on Ethics

- How much should you pay?  
    - As much as the market supports or should it match what you pay in the lab (roughly)?
    - AMT has been criticized for incentivizing companies to outsource labor without adequate compensation (for discussions see for example [here](http://priceonomics.com/who-makes-below-minimum-wage-in-the-mechanical/?utm_source=buffer&utm_campaign=Buffer&utm_content=buffer2d486&utm_medium=twitter), [here](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/the-unregulated-work-of-mechanical-turk/), and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julian-dobson/mechanical-turk-amazons-underclass_b_2687431.html))

- Can and should you get IRB approval for your experiment?
	- YES
    - Arguably, workers have more freedom of choice than lab participants (can stop experiment any time)
    - Wasn't very difficult to add to an existing IRB at NYU

# Being a good requester

## iambob
"I have done a number of his hits.  Then one day I get this email:
you received a bonus from Optimal Page Solutions for work related to.
The value of your bonus is $0.01 USD yes ONE CENT.   The requester
included this note:
If you spent half the amount of time looking for a job as you
spent scamming your way through Mechanical Turk HITs maybe you'd
be able to find a real job..."
The next day I get a block message from him.  WTF?! He asked for
the work to be done and I did it.  My hit total is under 2000 so
I do not see how I am a scammer in his mind.  I have done other
similar real estate write ups with no issues.
(from Martin et al. 2014)

# Be a good requester
- If your task breaks, workers *will* e-mail you!
- People like encouragement and feedback
- Courtesy and professionalism is important (you are a rep. of your university, lab, and field)

# Be a good requester
 
A few recommendations to keep workers happy...

1. Before running, .blue[test your experiment] on different browsers and the sandbox (AMT's testing environment)

1. Give explicit instructions and .blue[show warnings] about closing the page, going back in the browsers, etc.

1. Start collecting data in .blue[small batches]
 
1. If something goes wrong, provide an .blue[alternative payment method] for workers who are unable to finish or submit HIT
    - One way of doing this is to provide a HIT with no content specifically aimed at workers that had problems and pay them using a "bonus"

1. It is unethical to collect data in a poorly conceived or broken experiment (in the lab or online)
