# Agenda
<hr>

Everything today is hands on... we're going to try to do these three things:

1. Write a function to draw a stimulus on the screen (e.g., a circle)
2. Add a button to advance to the next trial
3. Display a sequence of trials

Please follow along using the copy of the ["super_basic_web_app"](https://github.com/gureckis/super_basic_web_app)
that you forked then cloned on git last week.
